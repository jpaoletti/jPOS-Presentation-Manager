/**Abstract class that represents a Menu in a generic form. The basic idea is that we can have a Menu
 * with submenus or a leaf menu, making this a recursive estructure. Any menu has a descriptive text, 
 * a parent menu (except for the root element) and a permission that indicates when a user can access
 * to this item. 
 * 
 * A menu is fully configured in a xml configuration file and it basic structure is something like:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <?xml version='1.0' ?>
 * <!DOCTYPE entity SYSTEM "menu.dtd">
 * <menu>
 *     <menu-list text="xxxx" perm="xxxx">
 *     		<menu-item text="xxxx" perm="xxxx">
 *     		...
 *     		</menu-item>
 *     </menu-list>
 *     <menu-list>
 *     ...
 *     </menu-list>
 * </menu>
 * }
 * </pre>
